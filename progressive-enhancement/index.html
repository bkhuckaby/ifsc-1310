    <h1>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h1>
    <h2>A Brief Summary of the Topic</h2>

      <p>Technology evolves at a rapid pace. Because of this, developers so often fixate on utilizing the latest software and their most modern implementations. Every day, new features are promulgated while older features are deprecated or altogether discontinued. The development landscape is one that is perpetually in flux, and the field of web development is no exception. In designing a website, developers look to build a product which is accessible to all users (i.e., all web browsers) while also employing the candy-coating of CSS and the dynamism of JavaScript.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, in the zeal to be cutting-edge, the developer may find themselves having to retrofit their sleek and shiny creation to accommodate the minimal features of a mobile browser or the draconian restrictions of a corporate intranet. When the page is stripped of its dynamism and style, its content is revealed to be incomplete, inaccessible, or illegible. The introspective developer returns to the drawing board and begins devising patchwork fixes for the content. The stubborn developer curses aloud at the dozens of people still using Netscape Navigator. Both have forgotten the most sancrosanct words: Content is key.</p>
      <p>Enter "progressive enhancement." Guided by the philosophy of progressive enhancement, one understands that content, core functionality, and the occasional (but necessary) text markup should be the cornerstone of web development and the foundation upon which any enhancements are built. Browsers may come and go, and developer toolkits will be introduced, augmented, and phased out, but given the philosophy of progressive enhancement the content remains stable and accessible. No longer are CSS and JavaScript annoyances, requiring constant patching or refactoring; instead, they simply enhance the user experience in supported browsers without hindering readability or functionality in less modern or supporting browsers.</p>
      <p>Progressive enhancement is not only a headache-free methodology for the developer; it is also design choice which ensures that users are not, in effect, "screened out" of accessing web pages. This is good for the end user and for the proprietor of content: Everyone gets an idealized user experience, and traffic to the site is not staggered or dampened by web development.</p>
