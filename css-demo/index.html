        <h3>Vinny's Op-Ed</h3>
        <img src="assets/img/car-crash.jpg" alt="placeholder" />
        <p>Hey guys, it's Vinny. Hey, I know I'm supposed to have an article for this morning's paper, but, if I'm being completely honest here, I got absolutely hammered last night on Peach Schnapps and strawberry milk mixers. My editor always tells me to lay off the drinking on work nights, but then again he also tells me that forty deviled eggs isn't part of a balanced breakfast. He's a real card, that one...</p>
        <p>Anyway, I'm writing this from my car as we speak. Don't worry: I'm not driving or nothing. I actually hit a letter carrier while trying to get to the grocery store. Guy spooked me so bad I hit a lamppost. I mean, really, if anything you should admire your author's tenacity. Do you know how hard it is to write an article in a time crunch when you're covered in diesel fumes and sodium azide?</p>

        <h4>YOUR ADVERTISEMENT HERE</h4>
        <p>Do you have a terrible side business you want to foist upon the general public? When you were growing up, did your parents tell you that you were special? Why not put more of yourself out there for the world to see? Remember: If you aren't actively making noise or being obnoxious, are you even really alive?</p>

        <p>It was an uncharacteristically chilly June day when Apathy 11 took flight. According to one onlooker, Dink Webster of Hoobastank, PA, the launching of NASA's latest manned spacecraft was "frankly, a forgettable affair, like my daughter's graduation."</p>
