    <h1>Review and Revision of the Microsite</h1>
    <h2>Collecting feedback and making adjustments</h2>
    <content>
      <p>In collecting feedback for the first draft of the Segway microsite, I found one major comment that was recurring among most reviewers: Much of the content felt flat and repetitious. In comparing the microsite to the websites they most frequently traffic, reviewers felt that the first draft was a bit too static and seemed hardly different from a standalone Word document. This made sense, of course; the first draft did not capitalize upon any use of JavaScript. From a developer standpoint, most of the first draft felt incredibly "hacky"; that is, much of the CSS implementations were unstable and shoddy attempts to stylize the page in accordance with the vision for the site. Little work was done to first structure the content. Dividing containers, especially, were lacking in the first draft, so styling rules implemented for the primary index fared very poorly when applied to the about and FAQ documents.</p>
      <p>Having recently read several articles on the subject of progressive enhancement, I decided to start anew and redrafted the HTML documents with newly implemented div elements. Attention was paid to the implementation of divs in such a way as to be easily applicable to all three of the pages within the microsite. In addition, I found that much of content within the primary index and within the FAQ could be clustered and obscured, only being revealed upon user request. To this end, I leveraged a minimal amount of vanilla JavaScript to default the product specs and FAQ text to hidden; this information would present itself to the user only if they clicked on the header for a given section. In so doing, the site felt far less busy, and the project began to feel more like a microsite.</p>
      <p>While the final draft of the project felt like a step in the right direction, I still leave the project feeling as though it requires much more work to fully leverage the provided resources. Given more time, I would have liked to have embedded the provided images in a sort of automatic slideshow, and I would have liked to have included some of the concept art as aside images to accompany the product specs.</p>
